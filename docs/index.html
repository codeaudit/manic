<h1>A Java implementation of the MANIC cognitive architecture</h1>

<ul>
	<li>Here is a <a href="http://uaf46365.ddns.uark.edu/lab/manic.pdf">paper</a> about the MANIC cognitive architecture.
		</li><br><br>

	<li>The first thing to know is that MANIC requires a "teacher"
		to help train it to develop reasonable priorities.
		In the Java implementation, a teacher is a class that implements the ITeacher interface.
		Here is a simple example teacher that prioritizes having a small first element of the observation vector:
<pre class="code">
class MyTeacher implements ITeacher {

  // Prefer plans that make the first observed element smaller
  public int compare(double[] beliefs, Plan planA, Plan planB,
    TransitionModel transitionModel, ObservationModel observationModel) {

    // Determine where the plans will end
    double[] endBeliefsA = transitionModel.getFinalBeliefs(beliefs, planA);
    double[] endBeliefsB = transitionModel.getFinalBeliefs(beliefs, planB);
    double[] endObsA = observationModel.beliefsToObservations(endBeliefsA);
    double[] endObsB = observationModel.beliefsToObservations(endBeliefsB);

    // Compare the endings
    if(endObsA[0] &lt; endObsB[0])
      return 1; // Plan A is better
    else if(endObsB[0] &lt; endObsA[0])
      return -1; // Plan B is better
    else
      return 0; // I either cannot or will not say which plan is better
  }

}
</pre>
		</li><br><br>
	<li>
		Here is an example for instantiating a MANIC agent:
<pre class="code">
ManicAgent agent = new ManicAgent(new Random(1234), new MyTeacher(), 8, 3, 2);
</pre>
		This agent uses an observation vector of size 8, an internal belief vector of size 3,
		and an action vector of size 2. All of these vectors are assumed to consist of continuous
		values. (If you need to use binary values, perhaps it might work to treat all negative
		values as false and positive values as true?)<br><br>

		The observation vector is the input to the agent. It contains values the agent can sense.
		The belief vector is used internally by the agent to model its world. It should be smaller
		than the observation vector, but big enough to represent the state of the world.
		The action vector is the output from the agent.
		The agent returns action vectors to indicate what it wants to do.<br><br>

		To give the agent life, just repeatedly call the "ManicAgent.think" method in a loop.
		This method expects an observation vector as input, and outputs the action vector that the agent chooses.
		Each time you call think, the agent will query the teacher to help it compare candidate plans.
		When the teacher is not available, or wants to see how the agent behaves on its own, she may just return 0,
		which means "I have no guidance for you at this time--choose for yourself".
		When the teacher determines the agent is ready to live on its own,
		she may just always return 0 thereafter.
		</li><br><br>

	<li>If you want, you can save the agent (including all the state in its artificial brain) to a file:
<pre class="code">
JSONObject obj = agent.marshal();
FileWriter file = new FileWriter("agent.json");
file.write(obj.toJSONString());
file.close();
</pre>
		And, of course, you can restore it from a file:
<pre class="code">
JSONParser parser = new JSONParser();
JSONObject obj2 = (JSONObject)parser.parse(new FileReader("agent.json"));
ManicAgent agent2 = new ManicAgent(obj2, new Random(1234), new MyTeacher());
</pre>

		</li><br><br>

	<li><b>What can this thing do?</b>
		Well, that hasn't really been determined, yet.
		That's why we are making this code available to the public.
		Have fun!
		</li><br><br>

	<li><b>What is the license of this code?</b>
		The file Json.java contains code in the Apache 2.0 license.
		I wrote everything else myself from scratch, and I released it all under a Creative Commons Zero public domain dedication.
